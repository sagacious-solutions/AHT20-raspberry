<h1> AHT20 Sensor Module </h1>

This is a script to read the temperature and relative humidity from an AHT20 sensor in javascript on a raspberry pi. Its not currently complete. Its able to query the sensor and get the requested data back in binary. I'm yet to convert it into a integer value due to lack of time. Your welcome to use it or complete it as you see fit. It likely just needs the math from a library in another language.
